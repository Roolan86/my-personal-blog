      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <br />
      <hr />

      <div class="story">
        I was born and raised in the <em>vibrant</em> township of Thabong in the
        Free State. I'm an introvert who loves meeting new people and doing
        things out of her comfort zone, yet I love my own company and will
        always opt to stay indoors and binge my favorite shows (one of them
        being Catfish on MTV). I studied for 4 years to obtain my Honors degree
        in Human genetics from the University of the Free State, after
        graduating I realized my passion lies in Tech, My curiousity and
        interest in how software works started with my obsession with online
        shopping (I know, I know, I'm not proud of it but I'm working on it
        okay.) I tried the whole corporate thing for 9 months and quit to pursue
        a career in tech. I wanted to change my life and do what I'm passionate
        about for the rest of my life. I taught myself to code and created my
        first React app called MovieLand by watching a Youtube tutorial. This
        was a life-changing moment for me because I <em>fell in love</em> with
        code and never looked back. Being a self-taught developer was not easy,
        but I was blessed to have a mentor whom I DM'd on LinkedIn but never met
        in person and has been so supportive of my journey since. Totally
        recommend getting a mentor especially when you are transitioning into a
        whole new industry like myself.

        <h3>From Geneticist to Software developer and Content creator.</h3>

        <br />

        Aside from being a software developer, I enjoy creating content on
        Youtube and Tik Tok. I love shopping online so (you guessed it), I
        create fashion content on Youtube and share my experiences shopping
        online especially from international brands. On Tik Tok however I share
        my experiences and advice on getting into the tech industry without any
        CS degree and purely bootcamps and certifications. This has been by far
        the most fulfilling journey to share with my followers because many have
        also drawn inspiration from me and decided to kickstart their tech
        careers. <br />
        Travelling and trying out new restaurants is my weakness, I've been to
        Cape Town, Mpumalanga, Durban, Kimberly, Bloem and hope to travel to my
        dream destination Zanzibar one day. I love that being a software
        developer will allow me to travel one day.
