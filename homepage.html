      <div class="story">
        I was born and raised in the <em>vibrant</em> township of Thabong in the
        Free State. I'm an introvert who loves meeting new people and doing
        things out of her comfort zone, yet I love my own company and will
        always opt to stay indoors and binge my favorite shows (one of them
        being Catfish on MTV). I studied for 4 years to obtain my Honors degree
        in Human genetics from the University of the Free State, after
        graduating I realized my passion lies in Tech, My curiousity and
        interest in how software works started with my obsession with online
        shopping (i know, I know, I'm not proud of it but I'm working on it
        okay.) I tried the whole corporate thing for 9 months and quit to pursue
        a career in tech. I wanted to change my life and do what I'm passionate
        about for the rest of my life. I taught myself to code and created my
        first React app called MovieLand by watching a Youtube tutorial. This
        was a life-changing moment for me because I <em>fell in love</em> with
        code and never looked back. Being a self-taught developer was not easy,
        but I was blessed to have a mentor whom I DM'd on LinkedIn have never
        met in real-life, and has been so supportive of my journey since.
        Totally recommend getting a mentor especially when you are transitioning
        into a whole new industry like myself.
